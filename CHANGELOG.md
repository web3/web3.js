- Add auto-reconnect option for Websockets (#3092, #1085, #1391, #1558, #1852, #1646)

### Changed

- Ensure '0x' prefix is existing for Accounts.sign and Accounts.privateKeyToAccount (#3041)
- Repository cleanup (#3443)
  - Removed old `docs/_build` folder
  - Removed old bower and meteor artifacts
  - Moved logo assets to own folder
  - Moved github assets to own folder
  - Remove @types/node from (non-dev) dependency tree (#3965, #3227)
- *Please note*: Geth [v1.9.12](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.9.12) contains a breaking change for `eth_call` that will not default to your first account anymore if `from` is not set. If a sender is not explicitly defined, the `eth_call` will be executed from `address(0)`. (#3467)
  - This was done to avoid the same input behaving differently in different environments. You should never do `eth_call` without explicitly setting a sender.
  - This means that if you're calling `view` methods that refer to a `msg.sender` without explicitly setting a `from` address in your request options, you may see unexpected behavior.
  - In `web3.js`, the `from` address can be specified on a per-call basis or by setting the `defaultAccount` property.
