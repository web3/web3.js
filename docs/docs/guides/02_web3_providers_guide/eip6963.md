# EIP-6963: Multi Injected Provider Discovery

## Introduction

EIP-6963 proposes the "Multi Injected Provider Discovery" standard, which aims to enhance the discoverability and interaction with multiple injected Ethereum providers in a browser environment. Injected providers refer to browser extensions or other injected scripts that provide access to an Ethereum provider within the context of a web application.

Web3.js library has utility functions for discovery of injected providers using `requestEIP6963Providers()` and `onNewProviderDiscovered(eventDetails)`.

`onNewProviderDiscovered(eventDetails)` can be used to subscribe to events of provider discovery & providers map update and `requestEIP6963Providers()` returns Promise object that resolves to `Map<string, EIP6963ProviderDetail>` object containing list of providers. For updated providers `eip6963:providersMapUpdated` event is emitted and it has updated Map object. This event can be subscribed as mentioned earlier using `onNewProviderDiscovered(eventDetails)`

`eip6963ProvidersMap` object has provider's `UUID` as keys and `EIP6963ProviderDetail` as values. `EIP6963ProviderDetail` is:

```ts
export interface EIP6963ProviderDetail {
	info: EIP6963ProviderInfo;
	provider: EIP1193Provider;
}
```

where `info` has details of provider containing UUID, name, Icon and RDNS as defined in EIP-6963:

```ts
export interface EIP6963ProviderInfo {
	uuid: string;
	name: string;
	icon: string;
	rdns: string;
}
```

`provider` in `EIP6963ProviderDetail` is `EIP1193Provider` and it contains actual provider that can be injected in web3 instance.

Following code snippet demonstrates usage of `requestEIP6963Providers()` function for providers discovery.

```ts
//Assuming multiple providers are installed in browser.

import { Web3 } from 'web3';

// Following will subscribe to event that will be triggered when providers map is updated.

Web3.onNewProviderDiscovered(provider => {
	console.log(provider.detail); // This will log the populated providers map object, provider.detail has Map of all providers yet discovered
	// add logic here for updating UI of your DApp
});

// Call the function and wait for the promise to resolve
let providers = await Web3.requestEIP6963Providers();
for (const [key, value] of providers) {
	console.log(value);

	/* Based on your DApp's logic show use list of providers and get selected provider's UUID from user for injecting its EIP6963ProviderDetail.provider EIP1193 object into web3 object */

	if (value.info.name === 'MetaMask') {
		const web3 = new Web3(value.provider);

		// now you can use web3 object with injected provider
		console.log(
			await web3.eth.getTransaction(
				'0x82512812c11f56aa2474a16d5cc8916b73cd6ed96bf9b8defb3499ec2d9070cb',
			),
		);
	}
}
```
